Every day we encounter a lot of cryptocurrencies over the internet. But the origin and behavior of these vary a lot. Therefore, it becomes essential to classify cryptocurrencies for a better understanding. Cryptocurrencies can be classified as:
1. 🅼🅴🅼🅴 : Cryptocurrencies that are derived out of a meme. For example, Dogecoin is based out of Shiba Inu dog meme. Its value increased by 12000% and now it has crashed.
2. 🅿🅴🅽🅽🆈: Cryptocurrencies having a value smaller than a penny. The majority of these currencies are newly introduced ones. For example, Oxen (Former name of Loki) was launched at a rate of $0.18.
3. 🅳🅴🅰🅳: Cryptocurrencies that are generally involved in Ponzi schemes and scams. These are created by developers and enter the market with a huge fanfare.
4. 🅶🆁🅾🆆🅸🅽🅶: Cryptocurrencies that are flourishing like Bitcoin which is valued at $33,475.
